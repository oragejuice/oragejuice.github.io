                <p class="intro-text">
                    Finjan is an event bus written in and for Java, 
                    By hand assembling bytecode at runtime we can call events much faster than using reflection, 
                    reaching near native speeds for calling java methods; java's reflection library has a large amount of overhead,
                    we can skip it entirely and directly call the method from its owner object.
                    Java by default prevents us from doing this as its not considered very safe. But sometimes the programmer does know better than the compiler.

                    A music player with search functionality, that streams music directly from bandcamp by web scraping.
                     Written in rust, it was the first project i had done to properly teach myself the languague.
                      Although its not in a finished state, and likely never will be, its still a very usable program and i often use it to listen to music.
                      it supports searching for music, creating playlists and queuing up songs. It displays album cover art amongst other things.
                    I used slint for the GUI, a library i highly reccomend as it was exceptionally easy to use.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    OmniPro is a program used to map keyboard and mouse inputs to controller inputs for accessibility and utility. 
                    Also written in rust, High effeciency is required for responsive inputs.
                    This was a project i was hired to do and one of my more successful ventures.
                    Some windows driver development was required as we had to intercept mouse and keyboard inputs before any other program.

                    This was the backend and frontend for a bot delivery system inside of minecraft, 
                    where users could request items from a storage in-game and the bot would deliver it to them.
                    controlled by a website, users could see all the items in the storage and buy items.
                    the bot would then find those items and deliver it to the player.
                    It was made using the actix-web framework for rust and mongoDB for storing all the items & making fast searches through the database.

                Orage-Juice was excellent to work with, they provided consistent updates during the development process of my app and were open to feedback. 10/10, 
                would highly recommend
